# AIP-Collection

## Description
**A**rbitrary, **I**nconclusive, **P**robably Useless collection is a collection that consists of my random scripts and projects that I don't want to forget. They are not important though, just a hobby. 

## The list

- [AIP-003](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/RamdomProj/tree/master/OCR_CRNN): It becomes classify task
- [AIP-004](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/RamdomProj/tree/master/bernoulli%20random): What if I collect a bunch of yes/no data in a gamble and use that to predict next outcome?

- [AIP-007](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/RandomScript/tree/master/crawl_mangadex): Download manga to save mobile data. It turns out there is Tachiyomi app doing that already. Update 2024: Tachiyomi is dead.

- [AIP-009](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/RandomScript/tree/master/maskOnDark): Too dark? Let's mask them all.
- [AIP-010](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/RandomScript/tree/master/stat_folder): Sometimes I need to quickly know my folder and subfolder occupying how much space. 
- [AIP-011](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/myblog): Should be a place I store my complaints. Turns out I didn't work on this anymore because it was too cringe to look back. 
- [AIP-012](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/khdlud_final_project): Shopee's goods, prices, and some analysis as my school project. 
- [AIP-013](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/software_design_final_term_project): Even the source code is a mess, I still need this as an example using Flask and put them as server on GColab.
- [AIP-014](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/phan_tich_covid): SEIR model here. Covid data from OWID
- [AIP-015](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/VNlang): From Golang to Vietnamese syntax programming language. It's usable you know. 
- [AIP-016](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/example_clickjacking): Good old clickjacking.
- [AIP-017](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/A-notebook-series): A notebook series. 
- [AIP-018](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/youtube-manim): I love the potential of Manimlib.
- [AIP-019](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/pyro-learning): glad that MLE/MAP tutorial is on Pyro's main page now. 
- [AIP-020](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/l2-distance-tracking-bbox): 2 bbox close to each other? It's the same object then. 
- [AIP-021](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/simple_shift_cipher): My first Rust project. Do you know `u` and `i` cannot be assigned to each other?
- [AIP-022](https://github.com/phamtrongthang123/unofficial_dynamic_fusion): Unofficial implementation of Dynamic Fusion. This one is cool. I played so much with functorch for 7 months. The only downside of this repo is that it is incomplete and not runnable :p. Don't blame me. None of the reimplementation out there is runnable after all. I doubt anyone can reproduce Dynamic Fusion and publicize it on Github. At this point, no one cares anymore.
